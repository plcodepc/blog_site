You’ll find this post in your directory. Go ahead and edit it.Lorem ipsum dolor sit am Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Exercitationem, iusto.Lorem ipsum dolor sit am Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Exercitationem, iusto.

And re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
